# Odin Recipes 

## Description
Often times, we find it dificult to keep track of recipes we learn and that is the reason behind this prject. With Odin Recipes, we are able to constantly keep tracks of new recipes we learn and it takes the problem of having to stress out brains to remember recipes we learn out of the way. 

During the course of this project, i did learn some best practice for writing HTML. I learned the importance of git and github and some industry best practice to using git and github.
