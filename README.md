# Odin Recipes 

## Description
Often times, we find it dificult to keep track of recipes we learn and that is the reason behind this project. With Odin Recipes, we are able to constantly keep tracks of new recipes we learn and it takes the problem of having to stress our brains to remember recipes out of the way. 

During the course of this project, i learned some best practice for writing HTML. I also learned the importance of git and github and some industry best practices to using git and github.
