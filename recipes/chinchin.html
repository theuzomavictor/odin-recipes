    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chin-chin (sometimes called chim-chim) is a semi-sweet, crunchy, deep-fried snack that is a staple at every major Nigerian event or holiday. As a child, my mom used to make this delectable treat on special occasions and used to let me help her make it, so this fun snack holds a special place in my heart. Now let's get into making it.</p>
