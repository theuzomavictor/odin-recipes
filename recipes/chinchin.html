    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chin-chin (sometimes called chim-chim) is a semi-sweet, crunchy, deep-fried snack that is a staple at every major Nigerian event or holiday. As a child, my mom used to make this delectable treat on special occasions and used to let me help her make it, so this fun snack holds a special place in my heart. Now let's get into making it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups (1kg) plain flour (all purpose flour)</li>
        <li>10oz Peak Evaporated Milk</li>
        <li>250g/8oz margarine</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup granulated sugar (add up to a half cup more if you want it very sweet)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        <li>2 eggs (optional)</li>
        <li>Some water (only if necessary)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the flour into a big  bowl.  Make sure the bowl is big enough for all the ingredients and for the initial kneading.</li>

        <li>Add the sugar, ground nutmeg, cinnamon and mix.</li>

        <li>Add the margarine in small chunks. Rub it into your dry mix (with your hands) until you get a good mix that feels like crumbs.</li>

        <li>Add your eggs, vanilla extract, and Peak milk and mix with a spatula. Then knead by hand until a ball of dough is formed. This is the perfect time to pull out your stand mixer if you have one, but if you don't roll up your sleeves because this will take some time and a bit of arm strength.  It will feel like there's not enough liquid and you will be tempted to add more liquid but DON’t.  The liquid you have should be enough. You just need to work it a bit to mix it. If you really really can't get it to form a dough, add a tiny quantity of water bit by bit till the dough is formed.</li>

        <li>When dough has been formed, cover the bowl and leave the dough to rest for about 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>After 15 minutes, you will notice that the dough is softer and knead it some more.</li>

        <li>Roll out small bits of dough and cut with a knife or a pizza cutter.  Do not use flour to dust the chin chin because this causes the oil to foam during frying. (If you mixed the chin chin very well, there will be no need to dusting with flour while cutting the chin chin.)</li>

        <li>Pour a generous amount of vegetable oil into a deep pot or deep fryer and heat the oil to 350F.</li>

        <li>As the oil heats up, test the temperature with one piece of raw chin chin. If the oil is hot enough, the piece of chin chin will sizzle and rise to the top almost immediately.</li>

        <li>Once you confirm that the oil is hot enough, collect some chin chin and place in the oil, be careful not to overcrowd your pot.  Stir to make sure the pieces don't stick together.</li>

        <li>Keep stirring occasionally until the chin chin browns to your liking. Remember, the chin chin will keep cooking when you take them out of the oil so don’t let them get too dark during the frying process.  (I generally cook each batch for 2 minutes and stir halfway through).</li>

        <li>When the color is to your liking, pull from the oil and place in a sieve lined with paper towels to collect the excess oil.</li>

        <li>Serve fresh from the fire or let it cool...whichever you prefer.</li>

        <li>When it's completely cool, store in airtight containers.</li>
    </ol>
